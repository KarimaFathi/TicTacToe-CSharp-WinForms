# Tic Tac Toe (Windows Forms App)

A simple two-player **Tic Tac Toe** game built with C# and Windows Forms. This project provides a clean, interactive interface for two players to take turns marking "X" and "O" until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

- Restart button to reset the board and play again.

## ðŸ“· Interface Overview
